# Minecraft-Blocked-Servers

## Description

Since Minecraft 1.9.3 r2 Mojang wants to ban servers if they don't comply with the Minecraft EULA. Mojang contacts
these servers by email ("Mojang BrandEnforcement"). If they still not follow the EULA the server address will be added
(hashed with SHA-1) to the list below. If the Minecraft client wants to connect to the banned server, they will just
disconnect with the message: "java.net.SocketException: Network is unreachable" which actual means the server is down.
